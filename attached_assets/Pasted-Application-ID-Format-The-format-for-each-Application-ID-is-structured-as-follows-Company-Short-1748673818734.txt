Application ID Format:
The format for each Application ID is structured as follows:
[Company Short Name] - [Three Digits for Facility] - [ActivityID + Two Digits for Application Number Starting with 01]
Each segment represents specific information about the application. Here’s a breakdown of each part:
Company Short Name:
This is a unique identifier for each company, which consists of the first six letters of the company name (e.g., "Lantic" for Lantic Sugar).
Facility Code:
A three-digit code assigned to each specific facility belonging to the company.
This code helps identify the specific location or facility for which the application is made. For example, the first Lantic Sugar facility might be coded as 001.
Activity ID:
A one-digit code that represents the specific activity related to the application. Here’s the list of activity codes:
1 - Facility Readiness Assessment (FRA)
2 - Comprehensive Energy Study (CES)
3 - Strategic Energy Manager (SEM)
4 - Energy Management Information System (EMIS)
5 - Capital Retrofit (CR)
Application Number:
This is a two-digit identifier for each application of the same type for the same facility, beginning with 01.
This number increases incrementally for each new application for a given facility and activity. For example, if a facility submits multiple EMIS applications, the first would be 01, the second 02, and so on.
Example Breakdown
Let’s look at some specific examples to see how this format works in practice.
Example 1: Lantic-001-101
Meaning: This ID represents the first Facility Readiness Assessment application for the first Lantic Sugar facility.
Company Short Name: Lantic
Facility Code: 001 (first facility for Lantic Sugar)
Activity Code + Application Number: 101
Activity Code 1 (Facility Readiness Assessment)
Application Number 01 (the first FRA application for this facility)
Example 2: Lantic-001-401
Meaning: This ID represents the first Energy Management Information System application for the same facility.
Company Short Name: Lantic
Facility Code: 001 (still the first facility for Lantic Sugar)
Activity Code + Application Number: 401
Activity Code 4 (Energy Management Information System)
Application Number 01 (the first EMIS application for this facility)
Example 3: Lantic-001-402
Meaning: This ID represents the second EMIS application for the same facility.
Company Short Name: Lantic
Facility Code: 001
Activity Code + Application Number: 402
Activity Code 4 (Energy Management Information System)
Application Number 02 (the second EMIS application for this facility)

ELEVATE ENERGY PERFORMANCE,
STRENGTHEN EXPERTISE, AND SECURE
ONGOING SAVINGS
Emissions Reduction Alberta’s Strategic Energy
Management for Industry program (SEMI) is
designed to provide industrial and manufacturing
facilities with knowledge, expertise, and training
in energy management.
The SEMI program will help participants increase
profitability by reducing energy costs, growing
organizational skills and capacity building, and
helping cover the cost of capital retrofits.
With $50 million in funding provided by the Government of
Alberta and Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), SEMI will help
the province’s industrial and manufacturing sectors increase
competitiveness and reduce greenhouse gas emissions until
March 2027.
ABOUT THE PROGRAM
SEMI offers financial incentives to cover up to 50% of energysaving project costs for for-profit organizations and 100% of
energy-saving project costs for not-for-profits and Indigenous-led
organizations. SEMI also allows in-kind contributions from the
facility to offset the co-funding requirement for certain energy
management activities.
All participants are required to conduct a Facility Readiness
Assessment (FRA) to assess the facility’s energy use, establish
energy performance benchmarks, and provide participants with
a roadmap to participate in other SEMI eligible activities.
AFTER COMPLETING THE FRA, PARTICIPANTS CAN
ENGAGE IN THE FOLLOWING FOUR ACTIVITIES:
Conduct an Energy Assessment and Audit.
˲ Up to $50,000 per facility.
Implement an Energy Management Information System.
˲ Up to $50,000 for facilities consuming under 400,000 GJ
annually, or up to $250,000 for those consuming more.
Participate in Strategic Energy Management training.
˲ Up to $100,000 per facility.
Invest in energy efficiency-focused Capital Retrofits.
˲ Up to $1,000,000 per facility.

ELIGIBILITY
Participating facilities must meet the following requirements:
˲ The facility is in Alberta.
˲ The facility is owned or leased (for a leased facility
permission must be obtained from a landlord).
˲ The facility has been in operation for at least one year with
fixed equipment and building(s) used to produce goods.
˲ The operation is defined by the following North American
Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes:
˴ 11 – Agriculture, forestry, fishing and hunting
˴ 21 – Mining, quarrying, and oil and gas extraction
˴ 22 – Utilities
˴ 23 – Construction
˴ 31-32-33 – Manufacturing
˴ 48 – Transportation
˴ 56 – Administrative and support, waste management and
remediation services
WHAT IS REQUIRED OF PARTICIPANTS?
To take part in the SEMI program and complete the Facility
Readiness Assessment (FRA), participants will be required to
provide certain information and facility access. This may include:
˲ Identifying an energy champion and executive sponsor
˲ Establishing energy goals
˲ Collaborating on energy “treasure hunts” to uncover
energy-saving opportunities and explore upgrading solutions
˲ Having a facility representative attend necessary meetings
and provide a facility tour with access to the relevant
energy-consuming equipment
˲ Ensuring facility management attends a presentation of the
FRA report
˲ Providing the information specified in the data checklist, such
as, but not limited to site layout, other process drawings,
energy data, independent variable data, sample maintenance
records, and operating parameters such as product mix,
volumes, and schedules
˲ Providing prior energy studies or assessments, sustainability
reports, or energy-related capital project documentation
SEMI will support industrial and manufacturing facilities
through four activities:
ENERGY ASSESSMENTS AND AUDITS
STRATEGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT (SEM)
ENERGY MANAGEMENT INFORMATION
SYSTEMS (EMIS)
CAPITAL RETROFITS
